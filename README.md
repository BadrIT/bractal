# Bractal

Bractal is a platform that enables you to get your React Apps, off-the-ground so quickly with a high quality initial infrastructure and UI components. It offers a wide range of easily customizable main components used in most web apps. Plus an easy way to extend and add additional components/modules of your own.

# Why Bractal

It differs from libraries like Bootsrap and SemanticUI, that Bractal not only provide UI components, but a way to extend and re-use components. Plus it's built from the ground up, on React, embracing concepts like styled-components. 

AND, if your app, is beyond a simple handful pages, then Bractal would be very handy to modularize your system.
