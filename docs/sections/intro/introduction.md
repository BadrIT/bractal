This guide shows how to use Bractal CoreUI components.

Bractal, in general, is following the concepts and principles of [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

In this guide, we list the main components provided by Bractal CoreUI. Out of the levels demostrated by the 'Atomic Design' link above, CoreUI provides the Atoms & few Molecules.

You might be asking now, why didn't we just used Bootstrap or Semantic. Our reason here, is that both tools aren't build from the ground up for React. Thus we found difficulties in applying deep customization to either tools. And thus we decided to move away from them, and build our tool from the ground up, to be tightly integrated with Bractal Core, and it's design concepts in general. Plus, it's built from the ground up for React.

NOTE: This is a WIP, and we're expanding this list of Atoms rapidly. Thus backward compatibility is not guranteed, and new versions might break current consumers. And we don't recommend using CoreUI in production projects yet.
